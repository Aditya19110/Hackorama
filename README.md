Solution for our Hack-O-Rama Hackathon solution.
The Pomodoro Time Management utility gives a graceful and intuitive interface for productivity. The header showcases the project identify and a fashionable circular Toggle Theme button on the right, providing a unbroken transition between light and dark themes. The principal content, thoughtfully organized in a flex field, consists of adjustable work and destroy periods, live timers with vibrant colorings and rounded edges, and responsive buttons for beginning and resetting classes. The session records is elegantly provided in an ordered list. The footer presentations a copyright word with a GitHub link. The CSS design employs gradients, subtle blur consequences, and transitions for a contemporary and visually appealing consumer experience. The JavaScript functionality effectively manages timer good judgment and subject matter toggling, improving the general usability of this nicely-crafted Pomodoro timer.
